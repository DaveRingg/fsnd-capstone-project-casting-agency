# Capstone Project: Casting Agency Backend

## Authetication

In this project we are using the Authentication Service from [Auth0](https://auth0.com).

[Here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/python#configure-auth0-apis) you can read more on how the API was configured, the JWTs were validated and the routes were protected.

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

It is recommended to work within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are libraries to handle the lightweight sqlite database.

- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.

- [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org) Gunicorn is a pure-Python HTTP server for WSGI applications. We'll be deploying our applications using the Gunicorn webserver.

## Running the server

From within the `./src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

Each time you open a new terminal session, run:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=api.py;
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

# API Documentation
## Getting Started
- Base URL by default `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
- Authentication: This version of the application requires authentication. Authentication Service from Auth0 was used

## Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    "success": False,
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```

The API has the following Handlers for errors:
- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 404: Not Found
- 405: Method Not Allowed
- 422: Unprocessable
- 500: Internal Server Error
- AuthError: Custom error trown when authentication is not in order
